Ki, a simple mobile agent framework, was described in a series of
articles for JavaWorld in 1998.

To run Ki you need Java -- any version of Java released in the last
ten years should be sufficient (you can bitch about Java all you want,
but Java code ages well -- I dropped the code, compiled class files
and all, onto a MacBook Pro and fired it up with Java 1.6 and
everything ran).

To run:

$ cd ki
$ java Ki
