This is a simple example of matching Java objects on the LHS of Jess
rules. Both Tank and Pump objects can be matched in this way. The
script pumps.clp shows how you might use these classes. This is a
real-time control problem; Jess is perfactly capable of monitoring and
adjusting the tanks and pumps to keep them from exploding. To run
this, type

        java jess.Main jess/examples/pumps/pumps.clp

from the Jess40/ directory.
